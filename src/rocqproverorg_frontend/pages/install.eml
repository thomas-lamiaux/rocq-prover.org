          Install the Rocq Prover on Linux
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Using your system's package manager
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Rocq Prover is available through many package managers, including most Linux distribution package managers.
          While this is currently the easiest way to install the Rocq Prover, it has the following limitations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Depending on the distribution, the available version may not be the latest version.
            See <a href="https://repology.org/project/coq/versions">Repology</a> to know which version is available in your distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            The available packages may not include all the external packages available for the Rocq Prover.
            Installing additional packages may require manual compilation and installation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Using the Rocq Platform (recommended)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Rocq Prover has a rich ecosystem of external packages (libraries and plugins) that extend it and make it more powerful.
          The Rocq Platform provides an easy way to install Rocq and a consistent set of packages on Windows, macOS and Linux.
        </p>

        <ol>

          <li>
            Currently, there is no longer a Rocq Platform binary installer for Linux.
          </li>

          <li>
            The Rocq Platform scripts install the Rocq Prover and its packages from sources,
            while abstracting over the details of running opam.
            This provides the flexibility to install additional packages with opam later on.
            It also supports installing multiple versions of the Rocq Platform and switching between them.

          Using Nix
        </h3>
        <p>
          Nix support for the Rocq Prover is well-maintained and provides a way to install the Rocq Prover and its packages on any Linux distribution, or on macOS.
          See the <a href="https://nixos.org/download/">Nix installation instructions</a>

          It is available in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maximedenes.vsrocq">Visual Studio Code Marketplace</a>
          and on <a href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/maximedenes/vsrocq">Open VSX</a>.
          To use it, you need to install the corresponding language server. Using opam, you can install it with the following command:
          </p>

          <%s! Copy_to_clipboard.small_code_snippet ~id:"install-vsrocq" "opam install vsrocq-language-server" %>

          <p>
          Starting from version 2025.01, the language server should already be installed if you installed the <a href="/platform">Rocq Platform</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          The language server is also available as a <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=coqPackages.vscoq-language-server">Nix package</a>.
