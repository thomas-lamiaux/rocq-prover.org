  Description of Rocq Platform Docs
category: "Rocq Platform Docs"
---

The [Rocq Platform Docs](https://rocq-prover.org/platform-docs/) aims to collaboratively create an action-oriented and interactive documentation for the Rocq Prover and its Platform.
Each core functionality and plugin of the Rocq Prover and the Rocq Platform will have one or several interactive tutorials and/or how-to guides explaining how to use them in practice.
They should further be available online through an interactive interface, which this website is a demo page.

The first tutorials are already available and can be checked out below. They can either be run interactively in a web browser thanks to JsRocq, or downloaded and run with a text editor able to interact with Rocq (e.g. RocqIDE, Emacs with Proof General, Vim with CoqTail, VS Code
with VsRocq).

    by all on
    [Zulip](https://rocq-prover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/437203-Platform-docs)

If you want to help writing or improving the documentation, before making a PR
please contact us on Zulip to ensure that no one is already working on it.

## Disclaimer

Not everything is perfect yet:

-   In the future, the documentation is planned to be indexed on the Rocq
    Platform's version, but as of yet, it is only guaranteed to fully
    work with the latest version of the [Rocq Platform](https://github.com/rocq-prover/platform/releases/tag/2025.08.2)
    for Rocq 9.0.1.
-   *The interactive interface only supports Rocq 8.17** as it relies on JsCoq1. 
    *It is likely to fail on many tutorials* that require a more recent version.
    We are working towards switching to JsCoq2.
