  Go [here](https://github.com/coq/platform/releases/) for a list of all Coq Platform releases.

  This is a patch release of the Coq Platform.
highlights: |
  - For Coq 8.19.2
  - Coq 8.12.2-8.18.0 available
  - Compatibility with opam 2.3.0
---

This is a patch release for opam 2.3.0 compatibility. Opam 2.3.0 requires modifications to opam files, which also affects the local opam repo of Coq Platform. Package picks and binary installers are not affected by this. This only affects builds from sources via opam.

For this reason no new binary installers have been created - the installers for Coq Platform 2024.10.0 remain current.
Please download installers from the [Coq Platform 2024.10.0](https://github.com/coq/platform/releases/tag/2024.10.0) release.

The remainder of the release notes is a copy of the release notes for [Coq Platform 2024.10.0](https://github.com/coq/platform/releases/tag/2024.10.0).

### Recommended binary installers

- [Windows (64 bit) installer for Coq 8.19.2](https://github.com/coq/platform/releases/download/2024.10.0/Coq-Platform-release-2024.10.0-version.8.19.2024.10-Windows-x86_64.exe)

### General information

See [README](https://github.com/coq/platform/blob/2024.10.1/README.md) for general information and installation of Coq Platform.

See [Charter](https://github.com/coq/platform/blob/2024.10.1/charter.md) for the concept and goals of Coq Platform.

See [CEP52](https://github.com/coq/ceps/blob/master/text/052-platform-release-cycle.md) for the Coq and Coq Platform release cycle.

See [macOS](https://github.com/coq/platform/blob/2024.10.1/doc/README_macOS.md), [Linux](https://github.com/coq/platform/blob/2024.10.1/doc/README_Linux.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/coq/platform/blob/2024.10.1/doc/README_Windows.md) for detailed installation and usage instructions.

### Major enhancements

- The MacOS installer is now not only signed, but also notarized. This means it can be opened on latest MacOS without work-arounds. You still have to confirm that you want to run an application downloaded from the internet.
- There are two major technical enhancements on Windows:
  - Support for arbitrary path length has been enabled by compiling all executables with a corresponding manifest. In addition this needs to globally enabled in the registry.
    The "build from sources" scripts check if this is enabled and if not ask the user to enable it. For running Coq from an installer arbitrary path length support is not required.
  - Ocamlc is patched to allow 64MB stack size - this way latest fiat-crypto can be build.
    Note that other applications, notably coqc, are not patched.
    The program to do the patches is available in the platform and can be used for other executables as well if needed.
  Now all Coq Platform packages are available on Windows, except coq-hammer (which makes heavy use of Unix fork)

No new packages have been added - this will be done in a soon to follow minor release.

#### Compatibility Coq versions

The compatibility versions are intended to help porting packages from an older to the latest release. They can be installed in parallel with other versions of Coq (Coq Platform will create separate opam switches for each Coq version).

Only the Coq 8.19.2 based package collections are available as installers for macOS and Windows. Other versions can be installed using the Coq Platform scripts or the binary installers from previous Platform releases.

### Notes

- __Notes on the macOS installer__: The command file to open a Coq Platform shell "coq-shell~8.19~2024.10.command" is not yet signed. You can still open it by CMD+click / right click on it and open. This is required only once.

- __Notes on the macOS Intel installer__: There are some issues with the Intel installer - it will be provided later.

- __Notes on CoqHammer__: The proof generation component of CoqHammer is available on macOS and Linux only. The CoqHammer tactics, which reconstruct generated proofs, do work on Windows, though. Since the CoqHammer tactic running on macOS and Linux creates simple and fast Coq tactic call snippets which are intended to replace the slow generator tactics, it is possible to use the auto generated tactics on Windows as well. Also you can manually write CoqHammer tactic calls on Windows. 

- __Note on QuickChick__: QuickChick requires an OCaml compiler to run. The binary installers for Coq Platform do not provide OCaml, so QuickChick does not work with the binary installers for macOS and Windows. It is recommended to use the "compile from sources" method if you want to use QuickChick. An alternative method is to install OCaml by other means and have it in the PATH, but this method is not supported by the Coq Platform team. We plan to add an OCaml compiler to the binary installers in a future release.

- __Note on SerAPI__: The SerAPI executables like `sertop` require that either the `COQLIB` environment variable is exported or a `--coqlib=${coqc -where}` or similar option is given. Other Coq tools like `coqc` determine the Coq library path from the binary location, but `sertop` does not (yet).

- __Note on coq_makefile on Windows__: The Windows installers don't supply make because make is quite limited without a posix shell. An addon is supplied which contains a Windows native gnumake and a patched template file for coq_makefile which allows to use coq_makefile and gnumake with CMD as shell.

# Installers

Binary installers are provided for Coq 8.19.2. The Installer for MacOS Apple silicon and the Windows installer can be downloaded below. The MacOS installer for Intel silicon will be available soon.
