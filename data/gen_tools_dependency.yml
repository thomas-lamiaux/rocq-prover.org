    synopsis:  Parser for the ATD data format description language
    description: >
      ATD is the OCaml library providing a parser for the ATD language and variousutilities. ATD stands for Adjustable Type Definitions in reference to its mainproperty of supporting annotations that allow a good fit with a variety of dataformats. This package also provides the 'apos;atdcat'apos; and 'apos;atddiff'apos; command-lineutilities.

      Atdgen is a command-line program that takes as input type definitions in the ATDsyntax and produces OCaml code suitable for data serialization anddeserialization.Two data formats are currently supported, these are biniou and JSON.Atdgen-biniou and Atdgen-json will refer to Atdgen used in one context or theother.Atdgen was designed with efficiency and durability in mind. Software authors areencouraged to use Atdgen directly and to write tools that may reuse part ofAtdgen’s source code.

It comes with an API to drive the interpreter and with an FFI for defining built-in predicates and data types, as well asquotations and similar goodies that are handy to adapt the language to the hostapplication.This package provides both a command line interpreter (elpi) and a library tobe linked in other applications (eg by passing -package elpi to ocamlfind).The ELPI programming language has the following features:- Native support for variable binding and substitution, via an Higher Order  Abstract Syntax (HOAS) embedding of the object language. The programmer  does not need to care about technical devices to handle bound variables,  like De Bruijn indices.- Native support for hypothetical context. When moving under a binder one can  attach to the bound variable extra information that is collected when the  variable gets out of scope. For example when writing a type-checker the  programmer needs not to care about managing the typing context.- Native support for higher order unification variables, again via HOAS.  Unification variables of the meta-language (λProlog) can be reused to  represent the unification variables of the object language. The programmer  does not need to care about the unification-variable assignment map and  cannot assign to a unification variable a term containing variables out of  scope, or build a circular assignment.- Native support for syntactic constraints and their meta-level handling rules.  The generative semantics of Prolog can be disabled by turning a goal into a  syntactic constraint (suspended goal). A syntactic constraint is resumed as  soon as relevant variables gets assigned. Syntactic constraints can be  manipulated by constraint handling rules (CHR).- Native support for backtracking. To ease implementation of search.- The constraint store is extensible.  The host application can declare  non-syntactic constraints and use custom constraint solvers to check their  consistency.- Clauses are graftable. The user is free to extend an existing program by  inserting/removing clauses, both at runtime (using implication) and at  \compilation\ time by accumulating files.ELPI is free software released under the terms of LGPL 2.1 or above.
