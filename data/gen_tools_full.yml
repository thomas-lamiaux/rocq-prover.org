    synopsis:  Coq tactics for rewriting universally quantified equations, modulo associative (and possibly commutative and idempotent) operators
    description: >
      This Coq plugin provides tactics for rewriting and proving universallyquantified equations modulo associativity and commutativity of some operator,with idempotent commutative operators enabling additional simplifications.The tactics can be applied for custom operators by registering the operators andtheir properties as type class instances. Instances for many commonly used operators,such as for binary integer arithmetic and booleans, are provided with the plugin.

For convenience it also provides a quotation and anti-quotation for Coq'apos;s syntax in λProlog. E.g., `{{nat}}` is expanded to the type name of natural numbers, or `{{A -&gt;gt; B}}` to the representation of a product by unfolding the `-&gt;gt;` notation.

    description: >
      This library provides `ring`, `field`, `lra`, `nra`, and `psatz` tactics forthe Mathematical Components library. These tactics use the algebraicstructures defined in the MathComp library and their canonical instances forthe instance resolution, and do not require any special instance declaration,like the `Add Ring` and `Add Field` commands. Therefore, each of these tacticsworks with any instance of the respective structure, including concreteinstances declared through Hierarchy Builder, abstract instances, and mixedconcrete and abstract instances, e.g., `int * R` where `R` is an abstractcommutative ring. Another key feature of Algebra Tactics is that theyautomatically push down ring morphisms and additive functions to leaves ofring/field expressions before applying the proof procedures.

    description: >
      The key features of this library are as follows:- It provides a great number of definitions and lemmas for common data  structures such as lists, finite maps, finite sets, and finite multisets.- It uses type classes for common notations (like `∅`, `∪`, and Haskell-style  monad notations) so that these can be overloaded for different data structures.- It uses type classes to keep track of common properties of types, like it  having decidable equality or being countable or finite.- Most data structures are represented in canonical ways so that Leibniz  equality can be used as much as possible (for example, for maps we have  `m1 = m2` iff `∀ i, m1 !! i = m2 !! i`). On top of that, the library provides  setoid instances for most types and operations.- It provides various tactics for common tasks, like an ssreflect inspired  `done` tactic for finishing trivial goals, a simple breadth-first solver  `naive_solver`, an equality simplifier `simplify_eq`, a solver `solve_proper`  for proving compatibility of functions with respect to relations, and a solver  `set_solver` for goals involving set operations.- It is entirely dependency- and axiom-free.
